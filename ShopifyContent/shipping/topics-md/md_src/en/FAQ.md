Find answers to some commons questions about setting up your [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) settings in Shopify.

## How do I provide free shipping to my customers?

There are a few ways you can offer free shipping to your customers:

  * [price-based rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/free-shipping/#free-shipping-over-a-set-dollar-amount)
  * [weight-based rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/free-shipping/#free-shipping-over-a-set-weight)
  * [free shipping discount codes](/manual/promoting-marketing/discount-codes/create-discount-codes/#create-a-free-shipping-discount).

## How do I remove shipping for digital products?

If you're selling a digital download product or a service, then you should [disable shipping for that product](/manual/products/digital-service-product/#disable-shipping-for-a-digital-product) by unchecking **This is a physical product** on the product's information page.

## How do I add handling fees to my shipping rates?

You can mark up your shipping costs or add a handling charge in two ways:

* add a fixed amount to your product prices (you can edit these from the [**Products**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/products) page)
* add a fixed amount to your [manual rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/manual-rates) or a fixed percentage to your [calculated rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates).

## Can I add product-specific shipping fees?

You can't add shipping rates for specific products. Instead, you can [create an order manually](/manual/orders/create-orders#add-shipping), or add a custom rate from the [**Orders**](//www.shopify.com/admin/orders) page in your Shopify admin.

## How do I add a custom carrier using my own credentials?

If your store is on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher, then you can display your negotiated rates at checkout by using your custom credentials with [USPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/usps), [Canada Post](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/canada-post/#use-your-own-canada-post-account), [UPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/ups), and [FedEx](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/fedex).

## How do I print a test label?

You can [print a test shipping label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print/#print-a-test-label) from the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) page in your Shopify admin or the Shopify app. You will not be charged for printing a test label.

## How do I cancel or void a shipping label?

You [void a shipping label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print#void-a-shipping-label) from the **Fulfillments** section of an order's page.

## How does Shopify charge me for shipping labels?

The cost of a shipping label is billed through [your Shopify account on your regular billing cycle](/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice/charges/#shipping-label-fees). However, if you reach your daily billing threshold for shipping labels, then you can continue to buy shipping labels equal to 10% of your threshold amount while a bill is being generated. Any purchases made during this time are included in your next bill.

If you cancel a shipping label, then its cost will be refunded as a credit towards future label purchases. The cost won't be reimbursed directly to your Shopify account.

## Can I offer my customers a local pickup option?

If you want to offer customers a local pickup option, then you can [add a free shipping rate](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/free-shipping), then enter a name that clearly labels the option as local pickup:
![Shopify Shipping - local pickup rate 1](/manual/shipping/local-pickup-rate.png)

During checkout, your customers will see something like the following:
![Shopify Shipping - local pickup rate 2](/manual/shipping/local-pickup-rate2.png)

>Note:
>This method is not supported by Shopify.

## How much does it cost to buy a shipping label through Shopify Shipping?

There is no per-label fee when purchasing a shipping label. Instead, you are charged the cost of the discounted label purchased through Shopify Shipping. Shipping rates vary but you can [view example rates](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/rates) to get a better idea of shipping costs.

## How do I make my shipping rates more attractive to my customers?

You can make your shipping rates more attractive to your customers in three ways:

  * [free shipping](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/free-shipping)&mdash;you can offer free shipping on orders over a certain dollar amount to encourage customers to complete their checkout.
  * [calculated shipping](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates)&mdash;you can charge exact shipping costs to avoid over-charging customers.
  * [flat rate shipping](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/manual-rates)&mdash;you can offer flat rate shipping to domestic customers to encourage checkout completion.

## What is the difference between Shopify Shipping and calculated rates?

If your store is based in the United States or Canada, then you can use [Shopify Shipping](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping) to [display calculated rates](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/setting-up-shopify-shipping/#add-calculated-rates-to-zones) to your customers and [receive reduced shipping rates](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/rates) from USPS or Canada Post.

If you're not eligible for Shopify Shipping, then you can [offer your customers calculated rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/#basic-procedure-for-offering-calculated-shipping) at checkout using your personal credentials through [USPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/usps), [Canada Post](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/canada-post/#use-your-own-canada-post-account), [UPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/ups), or [FedEx](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/fedex) if you're on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.

## Why does my shipping label download to my computer when I click **Print label**?

If you're using Google Chrome, then your shipping labels might automatically download to your computer instead of opening a print dialog.

To print a shipping label with these settings, complete the following steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/orders.md %}

2. Click the number of an order that you've already bought a shipping label for.

3. In the **Fulfillments** section, click **Print label**. This downloads the label file to your computer so that you can print it.

4. After the download is complete, find and then open the file on your computer.

5. After you've opened the file, click **Print**.

6. In the print dialog, select the printer you want to use to print the label.

7. Select the a paper size that matches the printer you're using to print the label. If you're [using a label printer](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/label-printers), select **4" x 6"**. If you're using a desktop printer, select **8.5" x 11"**.

8. After you've chosen the correct printer and paper size, click **Print**.
