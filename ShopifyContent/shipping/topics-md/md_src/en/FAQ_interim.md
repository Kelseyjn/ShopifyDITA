## How do I add handling fees to my shipping rates?

## Can I add product-specific shipping fees?

## How do I add a custom carrier using my own credentials?

If your store is on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher, then you can display your negotiated rates at checkout by using your custom credentials with [USPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/usps), [Canada Post](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/canada-post/#use-your-own-canada-post-account), [UPS](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/ups), and [FedEx](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/fedex).

## How does Shopify charge me for shipping labels?

The cost of a shipping label is billed through [your Shopify account on your regular billing cycle](/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice/charges/#shipping-label-fees). However, if you reach your daily billing threshold for shipping labels, then you can continue to buy shipping labels equal to 10% of your threshold amount while a bill is being generated.

If you cancel a shipping label, then its cost will be refunded as a credit towards future label purchases. The cost won't be reimbursed directly to your Shopify account.

If you want to offer customers a local pickup option, then you can [add a free shipping rate](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/free-shipping), then enter a name that clearly labels the option as local pickup:
![Shopify Shipping - local pickup rate 1](/manual/shipping/local-pickup-rate.png)

## Why does my shipping label download to my computer when I click **Print label**?

If you're using Google Chrome, then your shipping labels might automatically download to your computer instead of opening a print dialog.

To print a shipping label with these settings, complete the following steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/orders.md %}

2. Click the number of an order that you've already bought a shipping label for.

3. In the **Fulfillments** section, click **Print label**. This downloads the label file to your computer so that you can print it.

4. After the download is complete, find and then open the file on your computer.

5. After you've opened the file, click **Print**.

6. In the print dialog, select the printer you want to use to print the label.

7. Select the a paper size that matches the printer you're using to print the label. If you're [using a label printer](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/label-printers), select **4" x 6"**. If you're using a desktop printer, select **8.5" x 11"**.

8. After you've chosen the correct printer and paper size, click **Print**.
