### Set up your shipping rates and methods

When deciding what to charge buyers for shipping, you need to consider the following options:

- Exact shipping costs: Charge buyers the same thing that carriers like USPS or Canada Post charge to ship.
- Flat rate shipping: Charge fixed shipping rates based on order value or weight. For example, charge $5 to ship anywhere in the United States.
- Free shipping: Offer free shipping on all orders or set free shipping rules. For example, offer free shipping on orders over $150.

Unexpected costs at the checkout are the main reason why buyers don’t complete purchases. The most common unexpected costs are for shipping. Make your shipping costs clear on your home or product page to avoid surprises at the checkout.

### Add product weights

Shipping costs are calculated based on the weight and dimensions of your shipment.

To calculate accurate shipping costs, add weights to all of the products that you will be shipping. If you’re unsure how much your products weigh, then learn about [common product weights](https://help.shopify.com/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/common-product-weights) or [order a scale](https://hardware.shopify.com/collections/shipping/products/shipping-scale-10-lbs?variant=6777246273).

### Choose your preferred package types

Save your preferred package types on the shipping settings page of your Shopify admin. You can select envelopes, boxes, or carrier-specific packaging like USPS Flat Rate packaging.

### Get free packaging materials

Many carriers offer free packaging to use with specific shipping services. Although there is no cost for the packaging, you might need to create a free account with the carrier so that they can send the packaging to you. The following Shopify Shipping carriers offer free packaging:

- [USPS](https://store.usps.com/store/results/shipping-supplies-flat-rate/_/N-1bzu2g5)
- [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/packaging-and-supplies/supplies-forms.page?)
- [DHL Express](https://sbw.dhl-usa.com/SupplyOrder/SupplyOrderList.asp?nav=OrderSupplies)

### Print a test shipping label

If a customer pays for shipping, whether for the exact cost or flat rate, then you will receive the payment along with the rest of the funds for their order. When you print shipping labels through Shopify, you will be charged the cost of the label on your Shopify bill.

When you receive an order you can buy and print USPS, UPS, DHL Express, and Canada Post shipping labels from Shopify to ship your order. Depending on your Shopify plan, you will save up to 60% on shipping as compared to retail rates.

Labels can be printed using a standard desktop printer or with a supported [thermal label printer](https://help.shopify.com/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/label-printers).
