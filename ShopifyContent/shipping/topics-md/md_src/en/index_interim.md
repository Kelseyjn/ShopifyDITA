# Shipping

**NOTE**

You manage all your store's shipping settings on the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) page in your Shopify admin.

[Understanding the best ways to ship your products to your customers](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping) is an important part of running your business. Before you take your first order, you need to decide what shipping methods you want to use, and then set up your store's shipping so that your customers can choose a delivery method at checkout.
