If you no longer want to use a particular fulfillment service, then you need to make sure that their rates aren't offered to your customers at checkout. If your account with the fulfillment service is in good standing, then you can reactivate the service at any time.

#### Steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/settings-shipping.md %}

2. In the **Additional shipping methods** > **Custom fulfillment service** section, click **Edit** beside the fulfillment service that you want to remove.

3. Click **Delete**.

4. Select a new location that will inherit the stocked inventory and unfulfilled orders assigned to this location.

5. Click **Delete**.

4. Click **Delete** to confirm.

> Note:
> If you don't see a **Deactivate** button beside the fulfillment service that you want to deactivate, then you can find it on the [**Apps**](//www.shopify.com/admin/apps) page in your Shopify admin instead.
