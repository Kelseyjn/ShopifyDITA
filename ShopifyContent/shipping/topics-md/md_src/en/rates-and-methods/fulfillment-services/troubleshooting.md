## Why aren't my fulfillment notifications and emails being sent to the warehouse?

When using one of our [integrated fulfillment](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/fulfillment-services) or [custom fulfillment options](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/fulfillment-services/custom), notifications are only sent to the warehouse **after marking the items fulfilled** on the order in your Shopify admin. The warehouse will not receive notification until that step is completed.

## Fulfillment by Amazon

You might see this error message when trying to fulfill with Amazon:

`The request must contain the parameter PerUnitDeclaredValue`
This error message is returned if you try to send a shipment to an APO (Army Post Office) address. Currently Amazon does not support fulfilling to overseas army bases.
