With Shopify, you can use a fulfillment service provided that the warehouse youâ€™re using can process orders by email. If they need more contact than that, then you can work with a [Shopify Expert API developer](//experts.shopify.com/developers) to develop a custom app.

## Activate a fulfillment service

#### Steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/settings-shipping.md %}

2. In the **Additional shipping methods** > **Custom order fulfillment** section, click **Add fulfillment service**.

3. In the form, enter:
	* the title of your custom fulfillment provider
	* the email address of your custom fulfillment provider.

	When you [mark an item or complete order as fulfilled](/manual/orders/fulfill-orders) in your Shopify admin, the fulfillment service is sent an email with all the order information so that they can fulfill it for you.

4. Click **Add fulfillment service**.

## Set your products to be fulfilled by your custom service

If you use a third-party fulfillment service for a product, then you can't also stock the product in the  [locations](/manual/locations/) that you manage.


#### Steps:

1. From your store's [Products page](//www.shopify.com/admin/products), select the product to be fulfilled by the custom service.

2. In the **Inventory** section, select the fulfillment service that you want to use from the **Inventory managed by** drop-down menu.

4. Click **Save** to save your changes.

## Send sold line items for custom fulfillment

A fulfillment service will not ship an item for you until you [mark the order as fulfilled](/manual/orders/fulfill-orders) from your Shopify Admin.
