A fulfillment service is a third-party warehouse that prepares and ships your orders for you. Using a fulfillment service is a great option if you don't want to have to deal with shipping, or if youâ€™ve grown beyond your existing warehousing capabilities to a point where you can't ship items manually anymore.
