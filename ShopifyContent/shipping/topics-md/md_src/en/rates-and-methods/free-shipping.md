Having to pay extra shipping and handling fees is one of the main reasons why customers will abandon their shopping carts. You can encourage your customers to complete their purchases by offering free shipping at checkout.

There are a few different ways that you can set up free shipping from the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) settings page in your Shopify admin.

## Overview

Offering free shipping can be an effective part of your overall shipping strategy. You can offer free or discounted shipping to your customers in a few different ways:

* price-based rates
* weight-based rates
* free shipping discount codes.

Even though you offer a free or reduced shipping rate, you can still cover your costs or even make a profit in other ways. For example, you can cover the associated costs of free shipping by increasing the prices of your products. Customers are more likely to abandon a checkout because of the price of extra shipping charges than they are because of the price of a product that they've added to their cart.

## Let your customers know about free shipping

After you set up free shipping, you need to let your customers know about it. There are a few different places where you can advertise your store's free shipping:

* the theme banner
* a prominent place on the home page or on a product's page
* in an email campaign or in other marketing and social media.
