> Note:
> To buy UPS shipping labels in Shopify using your own UPS account, you need to be on either the Advanced Shopify plan or the Shopify Plus plan.

Shopify offers the best priced and most relevant services available based on time-in-transit information from UPS. If you connect your own UPS account with Shopify, then you can buy UPS shipping labels directly in your Shopify admin using the rates associated with your UPS account, and pay for them through your UPS invoices. Labels purchased with your UPS account can only be fulfilled from locations in the United States.

You should use your own UPS account only if you don't want to buy UPS shipping labels at the discounted rates offered through Shopify Shipping.

## Add your own UPS account to your shipping settings

When you use your own UPS account to buy UPS shipping and return labels, you receive the shipping rates that are associated with your UPS account, and you're billed by UPS (not by Shopify).

#### Steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/settings-shipping.md %}

2. In the **Additional shipping methods** section, click **Manage carriers**.
3. On the **Manage carriers** dialog, click **Edit** beside UPS.
4. On the **Edit your UPSÂ® account** dialog, click **Your UPS account** in the **Account to buy labels** section.
  >Note: If you want to change these settings later to use UPS rates through Shopify Shipping, then you can return to this dialog and click **Shopify's UPS account** instead.

5. Click **Submit**.

When you're charged for a shipping label, the amount appears on your UPS invoice in the **Internet accounts** section. You aren't charged for return labels until they're scanned.

If you have any problems with your UPS account, or if you have questions about the UPS shipping labels that you purchase, then you should contact UPS directly for support. To learn more, see [*Who can I contact for support?*](#who-can-i-contact-for-support)

## Buy a UPS shipping or return label for an order

After you've set up your UPS account, there are two different ways that you can buy UPS shipping labels in your Shopify admin:

* [Buy a single shipping label from an order details page.](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print#print-a-shipping-label)
* [Buy shipping labels for multiple orders from the **Orders** page.](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print#buy-and-print-multiple-shipping-labels)

> Note:
> When you use your own UPS account to buy UPS shipping labels, the shipping rates that you see in Shopify are estimates. The final price for each shipping label is determined when the label is scanned by UPS.

You can also [create a UPS return label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/return-labels) for any domestic order.

## Void a shipping or return label

In some cases, you'll need to cancel a shipping label after you've bought it. You can do this from the associated order's page in your Shopify admin. After you void a shipping label, you won't be charged for it on your UPS invoice. To learn more about how this process works, see [*Void a shipping label*](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print#void-a-shipping-label).

You can also cancel a UPS shipping label from your UPS account at UPS.com. If you do so, then the associated order won't be updated to reflect that change in your Shopify admin.

Return labels don't expire and can't be voided, however you aren't charged for unused labels.
