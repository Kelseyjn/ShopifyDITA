---

Shopify accounts without updated UPS account information had their UPS accounts disconnected on September 25, 2018, and any UPS rates associated with those accounts were removed. To make sure that customers receive shipping rates at checkout (and are able to make purchases), a flat shipping rate was added to all affected shipping zones.

If this change affects your account, then you need to review the replacement shipping rate. Since this rate isn't the same as your previous UPS rates, it might not match your business's shipping strategy. It’s important to change the replacement rate if it doesn’t reflect your actual shipping costs.

To learn more about shipping strategies, see [*Understanding shipping*](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping).

## Change the replacement flat rate

You can change or remove the replacement flat rate in each shipping zone where the UPS rates were removed.

####Steps:

1. In the Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > **Shipping**.
2. In the **Shipping rates at checkout** section, find the shipping zone you want to change, and then click **Edit**. In the **Price based rates** section, you'll see a shipping rate called **UPS Shipping**. This is the replacement flat rate that was applied to the shipping zone:

3. If you want to change this rate, then click **Edit**, and enter your changes. If you want to remove it, then click **X**.

To learn more about shipping zones, see [*Shipping zones*](/manual/shipping/zones).

## Continue using UPS account rates at checkout

If you want to continue to show your UPS account rates at checkout, then you need to [connect your UPS account](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/ups), and [set up calculated rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/setup-custom-calculated-rate).

## Show UPS calculated rates without an account

If you want to show UPS rates at checkout without connecting an account, then you can show Shopify Shipping UPS rates instead. To learn more about calculated rates, see [*Set up custom calculated rates*](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/setup-custom-calculated-rate#add-a-calculated-shipping-rate).
