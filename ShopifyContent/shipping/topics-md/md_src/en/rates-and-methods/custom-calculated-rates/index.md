>Note: If your store is eligible for [Shopify Shipping](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping), then you can display calculated rates to your customers at checkout. If your business is based in the United States, then you can display rates from from USPS, DHL Express, or UPS. If it's based in Canada, then you can display rates from Canada Post. You can then buy the discounted shipping label directly from your Shopify admin and print it at home.
