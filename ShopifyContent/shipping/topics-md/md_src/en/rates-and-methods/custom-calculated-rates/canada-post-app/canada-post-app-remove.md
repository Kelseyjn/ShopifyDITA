On January 10, 2019, the Canada Post for Shopify app was discontinued. Canada Post labels can still be purchased without this app.

Canada Post rates shown at checkout that used this app were removed. To make sure that customers receive shipping rates at checkout (and are able to make purchases), a flat shipping rate was added to all affected shipping zones.

If this change affects your account, then you need to review the replacement shipping rate. Since this rate isn't the same as your previous Canada Post rates, it might not match your business's shipping strategy. It’s important to change the replacement rate if it doesn’t reflect your actual shipping costs.

To learn more about shipping strategies, see [*Understanding shipping*](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping).

## Change the replacement flat rate

You can change or remove the replacement flat rate in each shipping zone where the Canada Post rates were removed.

####Steps:

1. In the Shopify admin, go to **Settings** > **Shipping**.
2. In the **Shipping rates at checkout** section, find the shipping zone you want to change, and then click **Edit**. In the **Price based rates** section, you'll see a shipping rate called **Canada Post Shipping**. This is the replacement flat rate that was applied to the shipping zone:

3. If you want to change this rate, then click **Edit**, and enter your changes. If you want to remove it, then click **X**.

To learn more about shipping zones, see [*Shipping zones*](/manual/shipping/zones).

## Continue using Canada Post account rates at checkout

If you want to continue to show your Canada Post account rates at checkout, then you need to [connect your Canada Post account](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/canada-post), and [set up calculated rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/setup-custom-calculated-rate).

## Show Canada Post calculated rates without an account

If you want to show Canada Post rates at checkout without connecting an account, then you can show Shopify Shipping Canada Post rates instead. To learn more about calculated rates, see [*Set up custom calculated rates*](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/setup-custom-calculated-rate#add-a-calculated-shipping-rate).

## Buying Canada Post labels

You can continue to [buy and print Canada Post labels](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print) directly from the Shopify admin by using Shopify Shipping.

If you want to buy Canada Post labels using your account rates, you’ll need to [buy them directly from Canada Post](https://www.canadapost.ca/cpc/en/business/shipping/find-rates-ship.page), or by using a [supported shipping labels app from the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/browse/orders-and-shipping-shipping-rates-and-labels).
