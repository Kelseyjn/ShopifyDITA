>Growth:
>If your store is eligible for [Shopify Shipping](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping), then calculated rates for UPS are enabled by default in your Shopify admin. You don't need to register for a separate UPS account, and can get started by [buying a shipping label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print) for your next order.

You can connect your UPS account with Shopify to offer negotiated shipping rates to your customers at checkout.

To connect with Shopify, your UPS account needs to have an account number (also referred to as a shipper number) associated with it. If you don't have an account number yet, then you can register for one online.

## Frequently asked questions

### What can I do if I've been locked out of my account?

If you've been locked out of your account, then you won't be able to update it or connect to it for 24 hours. After the 24-hour period has passed, you can try logging in again.

The most common cause of a UPS account being locked is that three errors were made while you or someone else was attempting to connect to or update the account. UPS can also lock accounts for other reasons.

To prevent your account from being locked, make sure that you avoid the following common mistakes:

* using an invoice that was received outside of the 90-day date range (45 days for accounts not based in the US or Canada) to authorize your account
* using an invoice that isn't one of the three most recent invoices that you've received

### Who can I contact for support?

You can contact [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/questions) for help with integrating UPS in your Shopify admin.

UPS customer support is also able to help you with issues related to your UPS account. You can contact them at 1-800-742-5877 (US & Canada), 03457 877 877 (United Kingdom), or by visiting the UPS [Help and Support Center](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-support-center.page).

### Can I use negotiated rates?

If you've negotiated custom rates with UPS, then you can show those rates to customers at checkout by selecting **Negotiated Rates**. This will also show any discounts or promotional offers you currently have active.

If you don't have negotiated rates, or you select **Retail Rates**, then customers will see retail rates set by UPS instead.

### Why aren't my negotiated rates showing up correctly?

After you activate negotiated rates, it can take up to three business days before they appear at checkout. If your negotiated rates don't appear after three business days, then contact [Shopify Support](/questions) for assistance.

>Note:
> If you entered invoice information while verifying your UPS account, your negotiated rates will show immediately.

### Can I change my contact information?

No. Your contact information can't be changed after it's saved. This does not affect your shipping rates or account verification.

### Why does a new user appear in my UPS account after I connect it with Shopify?

When you connect your UPS account with Shopify, a new entry appears in the **Additional Users** section of your account page in your UPS account. It includes an account ID that you might not recognize and the email address that's associated with your Shopify account.

This account is required, and you shouldn't remove it. If you do, then you will lose the connection between your UPS account number and your Shopify account. If you've already removed this account, then you need to contact Shopify Support to resolve the issue before your UPS and Shopify accounts can be connected.
