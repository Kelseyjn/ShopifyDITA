After you've [set up shipping zones](/manual/shipping/zones) for where you want to ship your products, you can choose the methods you'll use to get your customers' orders to them. You can offer several shipping methods for a zone so your customers can choose from a range of delivery speeds and costs at checkout:

  * Create price-based or weight-based shipping rates for regular postage services.
  * If your store's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher, then you can offer calculated shipping rates from USPS, Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and other carriers using your own credentials. Calculated rates are available on all plans if you use [Shopify Shipping](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/setting-up-shopify-shipping/#add-calculated-rates-to-zones).
  * Choose from available fulfillment and dropshipping services that will ship your orders for you.

> Note:
> If you manage your inventory across [multiple locations](/manual/locations), then you need to offer flat shipping rates or the same shipping rates from all your locations.

You configure all your store's shipping rates and methods from the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) settings page. These settings determine which shipping methods your customers see at checkout, depending on their location and the details of their order.
