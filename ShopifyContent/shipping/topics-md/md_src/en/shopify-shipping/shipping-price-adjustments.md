A shipping label price adjustment occurs when you [purchase a shipping label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print/#buy-a-shipping-label) and the carrier determines that you've provided incorrect or inaccurate information which results in an incorrect rate. After you've shipped your order, the correct postage amount is verified by USPS, DHL Express, UPS, or Canada Post. If you pay an incorrect amount to ship the order, then your carrier will credit or debit your account for the difference. Your package will still be delivered if there is an adjustment.

Price adjustment is a standard industry practice and all service providers follow this standard, so it's important that your shipping labels are accurate.

## Reasons for price adjustments

If your carrier determines that your shipment needs a price adjustment, then the adjustment appears in the [order's timeline](/manual/orders/manage-orders#view-an-orders-timeline). You'll receive a charge or credit to your Shopify account, which will appear on your next bill.

> Note:
> Depending on your carrier, your price adjustments will be charged either daily (USPS) or weekly (DHL Express, UPS, and Canada Post).

The following examples are possible reasons for price adjustments:

* the package weight specified on the label doesn't match actual weight of shipment
* the package dimensions specified on the label don't match actual dimensions of shipment
* a flat rate label is used with a weight-based rate box, or a weight-based rate label is used with a flat rate box
* the specified mail class is incorrect (for example, if packaging weight is above the maximum threshold for that mail class)
* the carrier charged a fee for preparing your shipment or non-customs documentation
* the carrier changed the return to sender fees

If you think that the price adjustment is was wrongfully applied, then you can [dispute the adjustment](#dispute-adjustment).

## Avoiding adjustments

You can avoid overpaying or underpaying for your shipping labels by making sure that your shipping and product settings are accurate.

There are a few things you can do to make your shipping labels more accurate:

* Weigh the item that you're shipping and enter the weight into its [product details](/manual/products/understanding-products) page.
* [Measure and weigh your packaging](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/initial-setup#add-a-package-type).
* Make sure that your [shipping origin](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/initial-setup#add-a-shipping-origin-address) and shipping destination zones are correct.
* If your carrier uses [dimensional rates](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/default-shipment-dimensions#how-dimensional-rates-work), then [configure your default package dimensions](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates/default-shipment-dimensions#configure-your-default-package-dimensions).
* Review your carrier's mail classes to make sure your shipment is classified properly.
