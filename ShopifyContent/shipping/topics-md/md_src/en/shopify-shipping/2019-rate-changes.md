Every year, shipping companies announce changes to their services, including increases to shipping rates. Here are the rate changes for USPS, UPS, DHL Express, and Canada Post. If you purchase shipping labels through Shopify, then you automatically get discounts on shipping rates.

## USPS 2019 price changes

On January 27, 2019, USPS rates will increase as USPS implement [pricing changes](https://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2018/pr18_086.htm). If you use Shopify Shipping, then you'll continue to benefit from low rates from USPS, with savings of up to 40%.

First-Class Package Service will change from weight-based pricing to [zone-based pricing](https://usps.force.com/faq/s/article/What-are-the-Zone-Charts-and-how-can-I-obtain-one). This means that the price you pay for shipping will be determined by the destination of your package, as well as its weight.

[Balloon pricing ](https://pe.usps.com/text/DMM300/223.htm) for Priority Mail will be eliminated. Balloon pricing previously applied for packages that shipped in zones 1-4, weighed up to 20 lbs, and measured between 84-108 inches in combined length and girth. These packages will now be priced based on their weight.

For more information, see the [USPS Postal Explorer](https://pe.usps.com/pricechange/index). You can also use the [Shopify shipping calculator](https://www.shopify.com/toolbox/shipping/calculator) to estimate current shipping costs.

You will still receive discounted shipping rates through Shopify Shipping. We're increasing the rates as determined by USPS.

## First-Class Package Service

Starting January 27, 2019, the package destination will now affect the shipping price, as USPS is changing from weight-based pricing to [zone-based pricing](https://usps.force.com/faq/s/article/What-are-the-Zone-Charts-and-how-can-I-obtain-one).

>Note:
>The maximum weight for First-Class Package Service is 13 oz at the post office. With Shopify Shipping, you can ship packages up to 15.999 oz.
