## DHL Express labels and customs documents

You can reduce paper waste and speed up customs clearance by using Paperless Trade when you ship with DHL Express. If you're shipping to a supported country, then you can submit your customs documentation electronically, and will only need to print the shipping label.

Destination countries that support Paperless Trade are covered in [DHL Express' Digital Customs Invoice FAQ](http://international.dhl.ca/en/express/customs_support/customs_paperwork/paperless_trade.html#faqs). If you're shipping to a non-supported country, then you will need to print the customs forms and attach them to your shipment.

## Signature required

All international shipments with DHL Express require a signature for delivery.

## Undelivered and unacceptable shipments

>Caution:
>Your customers will receive an email notification if duties and taxes are owed on the package. Packages with outstanding duties and taxes will be abandoned.

Shipments might be unacceptable or undelivered if they don't follow the terms and conditions outlined by DHL Express. There are several conditions that make a shipment unacceptable:

  - customs declaration isn't made, or the shipment hasn't passed customs clearance
  - shipment contains [prohibited items](#prohibited-items)
  - shipping address is incorrect or not properly marked
  - packaging is defective or inadequate
  - receiver fails to pay duties and taxes owed on the package

DHL Express will contact your customer for more information if the tracking status is **On hold**. If they can't reach your customer, then they will contact you.


## Submit a claim

If a shipment is late, lost, or damaged, then [email Shopify Shipping Support](mailto:shipping-support@shopify.com) to track your package and file a claim.

Include the following information in your email:

- your .myshopify.com address
- the order number
- description of the damage
- the receiver's phone number

## Prohibited items

>Note:
>Some items and commodities are restricted depending on where you're shipping to. Consult [DHL Express Terms and Conditions of Carriage](http://www.dhl-usa.com/content/dam/downloads/us/express/shipping/terms_and_conditions/prohibited_restricted_commodities.pdf), and make sure you're familiar with your destination country's shipping regulations.

Some items are prohibited from being shipped using DHL Express:

  - counterfeit goods
  - live animals (for example, insects, pupae, or hatchlings)
  - bullion
  - currency
  - precious and semi-precious stones
  - weapons and ammunition
  - human remains or ashes
  - items considered illegal in your intended destination (for example, ivory or narcotics)

Packages containing prohibited items will not be shipped. In this case, DHL Express will contact you and return your item.

For more information on prohibited and banned items, consult [DHL Express Terms and Conditions of Carriage](http://www.dhl-usa.com/content/dam/downloads/us/express/shipping/terms_and_conditions/prohibited_restricted_commodities.pdf).
