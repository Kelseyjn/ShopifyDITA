Every year shipping companies announce changes to their services, including increases to shipping rates. Here are the rate changes for USPS, UPS, DHL Express, and Canada Post. If you purchase shipping labels through Shopify, then you still get discounts on the rates.

----
## USPS 2018 price changes

On January 21, 2018, USPS increased its rates by an average of 4.9%. Shopify Shipping users continue to benefit from low rates from USPS, with savings up to 52%.

First Class Mail International isn't available as a shipping option after January 21, 2018 due to changes by USPS. Instead, Shopify recommends using [First Class Package International](#first-class-package-international-usps-specific) to ship packages that weigh less than 4 pounds. For more information, see the [*USPS bulletin*](https://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2017/pb22482/html/updt_006.htm) about these changes.

>Note:
>Your Shopify Shipping discount percentages will stay the same. We're increasing the rates as dictated by the USPS.
