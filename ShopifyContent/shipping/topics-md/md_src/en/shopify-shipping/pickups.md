>Note:
>Pickups are only available to stores based in the United States.

If you purchase DHL Express or UPS labels through Shopify Shipping, then you can schedule pickups directly from your Shopify admin. You can schedule a pickup at your preferred date, time, and address. Your chosen carrier will accept all eligible packages with a valid label.

>Note:
>Drivers will only pick up packages from their respective carriers.

## Schedule a pickup

To be eligible for pickups, you must purchase a UPS or DHL Express label in Shopify.

Pickup times are based on the time zone of the pickup address.

>Note:
>Pickup times are estimates and depend on traffic, weather, and pickup address.

#### Steps:

2. Do one of the following to schedule a pickup:

  - Right after you've purchased a shipping label for an order, click **Schedule pickup** in the **Package pickup section**.
  - From the page of an order that was fulfilled with UPS or DHL Express, click **More** > **Schedule pickup**.

3. Select the pickup address in the drop-down menu, or enter a custom address if you need your packages picked up at another location.
>Note:
>A custom address is not saved for future pickups.

4. Enter the name and phone number of a person that the driver can contact if needed.

5. From the **Date** drop-down menu, select the date for pickup.

6. From the **Estimated pickup time** drop-down menu, select the time window within which you’d like your package to get picked up.
>Note:
>Time options in the **Estimated pickup time** menu are based on the time zone of the pickup address.

7. If you’re scheduling a pickup with UPS, then select the option that best represents where the driver should look for your packages in **Package location**.

8. Enter any additional information for the courier (for example, buzz code or apartment number) in the **Special instructions** field.

9. If you're scheduling a pickup with UPS, then check **Notify the carrier that some packages weigh over 70 lbs so they come prepared** if your shipment is overweight.
>Note:
>You need to inform UPS if your packages weigh more than 70 pounds (32 kilograms) so the driver brings the proper equipment.

10. Review the pickup summary and click **Schedule pickup**.

You can view your scheduled pickups from the [**Orders**](https://www.shopify.com/admin/orders) page in your Shopify admin.
