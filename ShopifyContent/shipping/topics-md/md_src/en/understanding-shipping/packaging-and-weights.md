When you're fulfilling an order, you need to choose a package that matches the type that you want to use: ![Choose a package type during fulfillment](/manual/settings/shipping/choose-package-type.png)

You can [save your preferred package types](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/initial-setup#add-a-package-type) on the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) settings page or on an order's **Fulfillment** page in your Shopify admin. Most carriers charge by size and weight, so itâ€™s important to keep your packaging small. When you're ready to buy a shipping label for your shipment, you can choose which one of your saved packages you want to use.

>Want to save time and money on shipping? You can use [**Shopify Shipping**](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping) to buy and print shipping labels from your Shopify admin.


## Supported package types

You can use the following package types to ship your products with Shopify Shipping labels:

* **Box**

    A regular package. The total of the length, width, and height can't be above 84 inches.

* **Soft pack**

    A padded envelope, bubble mailer, or plastic (Tyvek or Poly) sleeve. Packages thicker than 3/4 inches don't qualify for USPS First Class Mail rates.

* **Envelope**

    A large, flat envelope no thicker than 3/4 inches.

* **Flat rate**

  [Flat rate packaging](#usps-flat-rate-packaging) is supplied by your carrier. Its shipping cost is not determined by the weight of your shipment.

>Tip:
>If your store is based in the United States, then you can [request a free USPS shipping kit](//usps.com/shopify) to get you started. The Domestic Flat Rate Variety Pack includes small (1) , medium (2), and large (1) boxes, which you can use to ship both domestic and international orders.

If your store is based in Canada, then visit [Canada Post's packaging best practices guide](//www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGabcmail-e.pdf) for more packaging tips.

> Note:
> If you are using Canada Post to ship internationally and you don't see shipping rates being displayed when fulfilling an order, then your packaging might not meet the requirements defined by Canada Post. For more information, see [*Parcel Services Shipping to the U.S.A. and to International Destinations*] (https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGpsus_int-e.asp#1389564).


## Unsupported package types

You can't use the following package types to ship your products with Shopify Shipping labels:

* **Letter**

    A flat envelope or letter thinner than 1/4 inch.

* **Large package**

    A package whose total dimensions (to total of the package's length, width, and height) are greater than 84 inches.

* **Irregular package**

    A non-rectangular package.

## Add a package type

If your store is in the United States or Canada, then you can save the dimensions and weights of your preferred package types on the [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) settings page in your Shopify admin.

>Information:
>If you enter dimensions and weights for your packages, then your [calculated shipping](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/custom-calculated-rates) rates will be more accurate.

#### Steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/settings-shipping.md %}

2. In the **Packages** section, click **Add package**: {{ '/manual/settings/shipping/add-package.png' | image }}

3. In the dialog, enter the required information about the package type: {{ '/manual/settings/shipping/add-a-package.png' | image }}
Some mail types have restrictions on the size of the packages that you can use to ship your products. A notice about applicable size restrictions will appear on the dialog when you create a new package type.

## Free packaging materials

Many carriers offer free packaging to use with specific shipping rate. Although there is no cost for the packaging, you might need to create a free account with the carrier so that they can send the packaging to you. The following Shopify Shipping carriers offer free packaging:

- [USPS](https://store.usps.com/store/results/shipping-supplies-flat-rate/_/N-1bzu2g5)
- [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/packaging-and-supplies/supplies-forms.page?)
- [DHL Express](https://sbw.dhl-usa.com/SupplyOrder/SupplyOrderList.asp?nav=OrderSupplies)

## USPS flat rate packaging

If your store is based in the United States, then you can use [USPS flat rate packaging](//store.usps.com/store/browse/subcategory.jsp?categoryId=flat-rate-shipping). Flat rate pricing is determined by the packaging that you choose as long as the package weighs less than 70 lbs. You are charged for the price of the flat rate box or envelope and not the weight of the package or the distance that it has to travel.

#### Steps:

{% include admin_sidebar/settings-shipping.md %}

2. In the **Saved packages** section, click **Add package**: {{ '/manual/settings/shipping/add-package.png' | image }}

3. In the dialog, click **Carrier packaging**: {{ '/manual/settings/shipping/package-type-flatrate.png' | image }}

## Common product weights

You need to include accurate weights for your products so that your customers are charged the correct amount for shipping. Accurate product weights also ensure that you're charged correctly for the USPS, DHL Express, and Canada Post labels you purchase through Shopify.

>Note:
>If you don't add a weight value to your products, then the weight will be set to 0.1 lb by default. This can make your shipping costs inaccurate.

Until you get a scale for accurate measurements, you can use the following general guidelines:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 18%">Weight</th>
    <th>Products</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than 8 oz</td>
    <td>Light items such as jewelry, watches, phone cases, light clothing (for example, a scarf), accessories, socks, or intimates. These items can be shipped in a poly mailer or bubble mailer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8-16 oz</td>
    <td>Most clothing items (for example, a T-shirt or blouse), or a watch in its case. Most of these items can be shipped in a poly mailer, bubble mailer, or a small box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1-2 lbs</td>
    <td>Heavier clothing items (for example, a jacket or dress pants), a cell phone in its box, sneakers, or light items that need to ship in a small box.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2-3 lbs</td>
    <td>Jeans or small electronics (for example, a small camera). These items can be shipped in a small box.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3-4 lbs</td>
    <td>A set of children's play blocks, a few paperback books, men's shoes, or a large camera with accessories. These items can be shipped in a small box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4-5 lbs</td>
    <td>Medium to large sized items (for example, a full set of sheets, or a puzzle box). These items can be shipped in a medium box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5-6 lbs</td>
    <td>Individual cookware, small tabletop appliances, or boxed board games. These items can be shipped in a medium box, though some larger books might fit better in another type of packaging (for example, a bubble mailer).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6-7 lbs</td>
    <td>Large toy (for example, a doll), work boots, or small sporting equipment. These items can be shipped in a medium box.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7-8 lbs</td>
    <td>Cookware sets, or medium tabletop appliances (for example, a toaster). These items can be shipped in medium or large boxes. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8-9 lbs</td>
    <td>Large radios, or DVD players. These items can be shipped in a large box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9-10 lbs</td>
    <td>Sets of items (for example, several books or pieces of clothing), or home decor. These items can be shipped in medium or large boxes, though some larger books might fit better in another type of packaging (for example, a bubble mailer).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

After you've added weights to your products, make sure that your packaging weights and dimensions are also accurate. Most carrier-provided packaging comes with dimensions advertised on the box. To learn more about adding a package type, see [_Initial setup_](/manual/shipping/understanding-shipping/initial-setup#add-a-package-type)

>Note:
>Advertised box dimensions may refer to the inside of the packaging, so it's important to measure the outside dimensions of your boxes.
