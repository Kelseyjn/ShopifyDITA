## Create a free shipping discount

If you want to offer free shipping, then you can create a free shipping discount.

Free shipping discounts will never automatically apply to an order. Your customers need to enter the code during checkout to receive the discount. To automatically offer your customers free shipping based on their order price, you must [set a free shipping rate](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/examples/#free-shipping-over-a-set-dollar-amount).

> Note:
> Set up a [free shipping rate](/manual/shipping/rates-and-methods/examples/#free-shipping-over-a-set-dollar-amount) under the
  [**Shipping**](//www.shopify.com/admin/settings/shipping) page in your Shopify admin. This will be applied to all orders that meet the free shipping criteria you've set.

2. From the **Discounts** page, click **Create discount**.

3. In the **Discount code** section, enter a name for the new discount code (for example, `freeshipping4smallorders`). To generate a random discount code, click **Generate code**.

4. In the **Options** section, select the **Free shipping** discount type.

5. In the **Countries** section, leave **All countries** selected or choose the countries that you want the discount to apply to.

     If you want to exclude free shipping for shipping rates over a certain monetary value, then check **Exclude shipping rates over a certain amount** and enter the amount in the field. This discount applies to shipping rates only, and is unrelated to order amounts.

6. In the **Customer eligibility** section, select who this discount will apply to: **Everyone**, **Specific groups of customers**, or **Specific customers**.

    Use the search field to choose the individuals or groups that you want to receive the discount. Customer listings show the email used to register for your store. If no email was provided, then the listing will show the customer's phone number.

    To remove an individual customer or group of customers from eligibility for a discount, click the **X** next to the customer's or group's name.

    To learn more about creating customer groups, see [_Managing customers_](/manual/customers/manage-customers#create-customer-groups).

7. Discount usage is unlimited by default. If you want to limit discount usage, then check one of the options in the **Usage limits** section:
   - **Limit number of times this discount can be used in total** lets you set a total number of times a discount can be used. For example, setting a limit of 200 allows the discount code to be used 200 times across your customer base. If you choose this setting, then customers can use the discount multiple times.
   - **Limit to one per customer** tracks customer emails to limit discount use to one per customer.

8. Use the calendar in the **Active dates** section to set the start date for the discount. If you want to set an end date for the discount, then click **Set end date** and use the calendar to choose when the discount will end:

    ![Discount dates](/manual/discounts/discount-active-dates.png)

    If you don't choose an end date for your discount, then it will have no expiry. If you want the discount to be valid for only one day, then select the same calendar day for both the start date and the end date.

    > Note:
    > The time when the discount starts and ends depends on the [timezone that you selected in your Shopify admin](/manual/intro-to-shopify/initial-setup/setup-business-settings/#set-or-change-your-store-timezone). For example, if your store’s timezone is Eastern Standard Time and you select a start date of November 26, then your discount will start at 12 a.m. EST on November 26.

9. When you are finished, click **Save discount**.

Your new discount will now appear on the [**Discounts**](//www.shopify.com/admin/discounts) page in your Shopify admin. To distribute this discount, you can send the code to your customers by email, or display it on your online store.
