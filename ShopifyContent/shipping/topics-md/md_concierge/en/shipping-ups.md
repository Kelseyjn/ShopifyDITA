To connect with Shopify, your UPS account needs to have an account number (also referred to as a shipper number) associated with it. If you don't have an account number yet, then you can register for one online.

To connect your own UPS account, your store needs to be on either the Advanced Shopify or Shopify Plus plan.

If you have any problems with setting up your UPS account, then [contact UPS](#who-can-i-contact-for-support) directly.
