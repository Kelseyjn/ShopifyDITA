After you've [set up shipping label printing](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print) in your Shopify admin, you can view and compare calculated shipping rates from an order's **Fulfillment** page. Depending on your Shopify plan and your shipment, you'll be eligible for reduced rates from **USPS**, **UPS**, **DHL Express**, and **Canada Post**.

For example rates with Shopify Shipping, visit the Help Center.
