1. Check to make sure you have a shipping zone for that shipping address.

2. If you are using third-party rates or weight-based rates, then make sure the products in the order have a weight and are tagged to require shipping. Make sure there is a rate that applies to the total weight of the order.

3. If you are using price-based rates, then make sure the price of the order is within range for the rates you've set up.
