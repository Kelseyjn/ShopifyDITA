If you've negotiated a discounted rate with USPS, then you can enter your User ID when you activate your USPS service in your Shopify admin so that the discounted rate appears to your customers at checkout.

If your store is eligible for [Shopify Shipping](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping), then calculated rates for USPS are enabled by default in your Shopify admin. You do not need to register for a separate USPS User ID, and can get started by [buying a shipping label](/manual/shipping/shopify-shipping/buy-and-print) for your next order.
