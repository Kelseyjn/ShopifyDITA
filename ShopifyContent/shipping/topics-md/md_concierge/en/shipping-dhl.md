You can buy shipping labels in your Shopify admin or the Shopify app to speed up your packaging and fulfillment process, save time at the post office, display calculated rates to your customers, and get reduced shipping rates from **USPS**, **DHL Express**, **UPS**, or **Canada Post**. After you've bought a shipping label, you can print it, affix it to the outside of your package, and then ship the package from any post office.
