1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Settings > Shipping**.

2. In the **Dropshipping and fulfillment services** section, click **Add dropshipping service** if you haven't activated a service yet. If you've already added a service and want to add another, then click **Manage services** instead.

3. On the **Fulfillment and dropshipping** page, find the **Fulfillment by Amazon** section and then click **Activate**.

4. Set up a new account with Amazon, or enter your existing credentials into the fields. After you've activated Fulfillment by Amazon, you should [add Amazon's shipping rates](#set-shipping-rates-for-fulfillment-by-amazon) to your own shipping settings.
